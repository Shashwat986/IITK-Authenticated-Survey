Webpage to conduct authenticated surveys for IIT Kanpur students.

Uses the login details of IIT Kanpur webmail as authentication, verifies them, and then allows people to answer the survey.

The survey is not mapped to the user name, and passwords are not stored. As a result, people are only allowed to log-in and answer questions once. If someone logs in, sees the questions, and logs out, he/she can re-login.
